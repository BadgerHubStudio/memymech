# Coming Soon 

Upcoming roguelike farming simulation... with mechs!

Developed by [Badger Hub](https://badgerhub.studio)

## We are very early in development, but you can expect:
- a lived-in world with many NPCs and unfolding stories
- Mechs that you will only use for rebuilding the world(no violence!)
- Each play through to feel unique
- Shop Cat

## Look for Me, My Mech and I on Steam Early access Summer 2023
